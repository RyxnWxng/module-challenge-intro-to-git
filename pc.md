## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

3. Branches are copies of the main code that we had made edits to.
4. A pull request is how you send your contributions to be reviewed and edited and submitted into the project.
5. The command to switch between branches is "git checkout main"
6. 'git fetch' downloads objects and refs from another repository. 'Git merge' joins multiple development histories together. 'Git pull' fetches and integrates with another repository or local branch.
7. A merge conflict is when there are competing commits occurring when you merge branches.
8. To resolve a merge conflict, you want to decide which branch changes you want to keep and delete the conflict markers and make final changes.
